# Chronical-Kidney-Disease-Using-ML

Because of the increasing number of patients, the high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the poor prognosis of morbidity and mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) places a significant burden on the healthcare system. The goal of this research is to create a machine-learning model that can predict the early-stage chronical kidney desies. A total of 400 people were chosen. The Random Forest model performed best with a 0.989 accuracy. The model proposed in this study may be useful for policymakers in predicting CKD trends in the population. The models can enable close monitoring of people at risk, early detection of CKD, better resource allocation, and patient-centred management.

## Goal:

Our kidneys are responsible for filtering blood and removing waste in the form of urine. It also known as chronic kidney failure, Dangerous quantities of fluid, and wastes can build up in the body at advanced stages. Patients must then undergo dialysis or consider a transplant if this occurs.
Our goal in this experiment is to investigate if we can use 24 variables to predict whether a patient will develop chronic kidney disease or not. We may be able to recognize and help patients at risk of kidney failure if we can identify characteristics that have a strong influence on kidney failure.
These ML-based models, in the opinion of policymakers, could be efficiently used in resource management and initiating public health initiatives such as closely monitoring and early detection of CKD. Clearly, for such models to be used in clinical practise with individual patients, the feature set would need to be expanded to include laboratory measurements and possibly lifestyle information, which will be addressed in future research.
